## General Information
The project was designed with the purpose of developing a web application that optimizes communication in the educational community of the Instituto Superior de Profesorado N¬∫ 63 ‚ÄúNatalia Quess√∫s‚Äù. The platform allows users to easily access institutional information, including educational offerings, activities, news and events.
With an intuitive and well-organized interface, the application offers specific tools for each user group:
- Students: they can consult their subjects, register for exams, check grades and manage other academic procedures.
- Teachers: have the ability to record grades and automatically notify students.
- Administrators: they have a complete tool to manage students, teachers, courses, exam schedules, registrations and exam results.
In short, the platform not only improves the institute's visibility, but also optimizes communication and academic management processes.
